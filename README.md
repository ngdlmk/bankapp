# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

📱 Screen Features & Functionality
1. Splash Screen (screens/splash)
- Animation: Uses Animated.parallel for a smooth Scale & Fade-in effect on the logo.

- Logic: Checks SecureStore for an existing user token.

- Routing: Automatically directs to Login (if new) or Security Screen (if returning).

2. Login Screen (screens/login)
- Auth0 Integration: Embeds a secure WebView to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.

- Token Management: Intercepts the authentication code/token and securely saves it to the device Keychain.

3. Security Screen (screens/security)
- Context Aware: Acts as both a "Create PIN" screen (first setup) and "Unlock" screen.

- Biometrics: Automatically triggers FaceID/TouchID via expo-local-authentication.

- PIN Fallback: Custom-built numeric keypad with dot indicators for users without biometrics.

- Privacy: This screen is automatically invoked when the app moves to the background to protect sensitive data.

4. Dashboard (screens/dashboard)
- Dynamic Theming: Supports Light/Dark mode switching (via Unistyles).

- Data Visualization: Lists accounts with formatted currency.

- Interactivity: Tapping an account opens a modal with transaction history.

- Smart Styling: Income (Credit) and Expense (Debit) transactions are automatically colored green or black based on value.

5. Help / AI Support (screens/help)
- ChatGPT Integration: Connects to OpenAI API to answer banking queries.

- Persistence: Uses MMKV to store chat history locally, so messages aren't lost on close.

- Context: Sends previous conversation history to OpenAI to maintain context.

- Please use your OpenAI key on this screen const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-proj-xxx'; ./src/screens/help/help-screen.tsx
